# Hand-Written-Recognition-of-Urdu
This project implements an image classification system using RANDOM FOREST model in python. It loads grayscale images from a specified folders, preprocesses them by resizing and flattening and assigns labels automatically. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained to classify images based on extracted features.
🔍 Image Classification Using Random Forest
📌 Project Overview
This project implements an image classification system using machine learning. The goal is to train a Random Forest Classifier to recognize and classify characters from grayscale images. The model is trained on a dataset of character images, preprocessed, and evaluated for accuracy.

🚀 Key Features
✔ Loads and processes image data from multiple folders
✔ Resizes and flattens images for efficient feature extraction
✔ Splits data into training and testing sets for evaluation
✔ Trains a Random Forest Classifier to learn patterns in the data
✔ Evaluates performance using accuracy and F1-score metrics
✔ Predicts new images by classifying unseen data
